# Treehouse_Python_Dungeon_Game
The Dungeon game from the Treehouse Collections module

This is the exercise for the Python Collections module.  The first commit is the pseudo code given in the video, along with some basic code i used to get it behaving.
I will grab the finished code from the teacher to show the difference between his solution and mine.
This is not to say either is better or worse, just that this was my solution without following along.

FWIW, I would probably not have used a list of tuples as a map.  I probably would've gone with a list of lists as rows and columns.
